## Directory Checker

Directory Checker is a simple bash script designed to track changes in a specified source directory and copy those changes to a remote server.

### Usage

1. Set the correct path for the monitored directory, destination server, and archive password in the script:

   ```bash
   source_dir="/path/to/source/directory"
   dest_server="username@destination-server:/path/to/destination/directory"
   arch_password="YourArchivePassword"


## MJML Renderer


MJML Renderer is a Python script that takes an MJML file, sends it to the MJML API for rendering, and saves the resulting HTML to an output file.  
I prepare 2 scripts which do the same thing.

### Usage

1. Set the path to your MJML file (`mjml_file_path`) and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your MJML API key (`api_key`) in the script:

   ```python
   mjml_file_path = "./file.mjml"
   api_key = "YourMJMLAPIKey"

2. Install required libraries
```python
   pip install requests
